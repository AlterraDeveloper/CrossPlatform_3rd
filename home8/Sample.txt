Ed Stafford from the UK is the first person to walk along the Amazon River from 
the mountains of Peru to the mouth of the river in Brazil. 
His amazing journey took two years and four months. 
There are many dangerous animals in the rainforest, 
like snakes and crocodiles, 
but Ed was lucky; he was only bitten by ants and mosquitoes. 
On his trip, Ed had to find fruit and nuts or catch fish each morning. 
Sometimes food was hard to find and Ed was often tired and hungry.

Technology was very important for Ed. 
He used a radio to ask the people of the rainforest for food and help. 
Many people came to meet him and guide him through the rainforest. 
While he walked, Ed wrote a blog to tell the world about climate 
change and destruction of the rainforest.
