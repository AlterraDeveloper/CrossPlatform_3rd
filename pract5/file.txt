Capturing groups are so named because, during a match, each 
subsequence of the input sequence 
that matches such 
a
group is saved. 
The captured subsequence 
may be used later in the expression, via 
a
back reference, 
and may also be retrieved from the matcher 
once the match operation is complete.
